At Amrut AI, I'm a core product engineer on an AI-driven SEO and business-intelligence platform, where I design backend architecture, build automation and data pipelines, integrate external data ecosystems, and ship production systems used for real business decisions. I've built a conversational AI agent grounded in Vertex AI semantic search over 400K+ embeddings, batch pipelines processing 1M+ URLs, a Firestore-to-BigQuery analytics warehouse, and 40+ REST endpoints alongside 20+ Next.js / React dashboard tools. Beyond product work, I take on freelance projects through my studio, Trident Square — building websites, apps, and AI integrations for startups and businesses. I care about ownership, performance, and shipping things that actually work.`;
